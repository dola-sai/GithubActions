Testing Github Actions

GitHub Actions helps automate tasks within your software development life cycle. It's particularly useful for continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) processes. Actions are custom workflows that you define in your repository using YAML syntax. These workflows can handle common tasks such as building code, running tests, and deploying to production environments.

A workflow in GitHub Actions is made up of one or more jobs. Jobs can run sequentially or in parallel and are made up of steps. Each step in a job executes a specific action, and these actions can be reusable pieces of code written by you or shared by the GitHub community in the Marketplace.

I will be exploring and testing Github Actions here in this Repository.
